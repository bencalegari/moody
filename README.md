# moody

A mood based playlist generator using the EchoNest API built at Launch Academy's Ship It Saturday in January/March. 

I interned at the nest back before I learned web development and did a lot of work Q/Aing their API so I've always wanted to try it out for myself. This was the result. Put in some moods then it generates spotify embed links of all the songs returned from EN.
